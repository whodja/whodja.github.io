    <p class="caption"><b>Flappy Bird Clone</b><br> This project involved working in app development to create a clone
    of the popular mobile game, Flappy Bird. Through several months dedicated to in-game physics and user interface, this 
    clone was made to mimic the playability of the beloved game that no longer exists for purchase. It was created through Android Studio using JavaScript,
    C++, and Kotlin.</p>

    <img src="VideoGameSC.png" alt="Dungeon Game" class="image">
    <p class="caption"><b>Dungeon Game</b><br> This project involved making an in-depth dungeon RPG Game. The user takes
    the role of a hero seeking to fight their way through the dungeon to find the treasure. As they progress, they will encounter
    evil zombies, skeletons, and other creatures who will try to defeat them. At any time, they may access the shop to purchase better weapons,
    potions, and tools to fight. This was entirely coded using Python.</p>

    <img src="CardsSC.png" alt="Cards Game" class="image">
    <p class="caption"><b>Cards Game</b><br> This project involved creating a card game for the user to play. The user must pick
    any card within a 52-card deck. They will then go against the CPU to see if they had the same as a random card that was already pulled.
    This program was made entirely using C++.</p>
